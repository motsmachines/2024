                <b>Abstract:</b> <br> I explore some ways digital tools can create, assist and inspire song lyric writing by presenting some examples of language treatment tools specific to this activity and some experiments using generically-trained LLMs.

Many song styles pose constraints on the lyric text needed,  particularly in terms of word choice, including the selection of rhymes suitable for the subject context, and the adherence to stress patterns dictated by the music or existing lines of text. 
While digital tools can assist with these aspects, wholesale writing of complete sets of lyrics by LLM-based tools creates a paradox. The generic nature of responses tends to produce lyrics lacking in specifics that would otherwise add relatability, plausibility and memorability. Using Chat GPT I tested queries that could channel LLM output into something less generic.

Songwriters welcome AI tools with varying enthusiasm. I make a round-up of some impressions gathered among an online songwriting community. 

Finally, I take look at a few examples of interactive and commercial applications.

<li>14h00 Adam Jatowt Estimating - Temporal Validity of Text
        <details style="margin-left:50px"><summary> Details </summary>
                
                <b>Abstract:</b><br>
        It is important to learn whether information is still valid or not for various downstream applications including recommender systems, information retrieval, and user state tracking on microblogs and via chatbot conversations. It is also beneficial to deeply understand the story by tracking implicit information about the durations of protagonists' activities and involved events. However, this kind of inference is still difficult for machines as it usually requires temporal commonsense knowledge and reasoning. We propose and investigate a series of novel tasks related to temporal commonsense reasoning such as temporal validity estimation, temporal validity reassessment, and temporal validity change prediction of an input text given some follow-up context. In essence, these tasks require inference whether actions expressed in text are still ongoing or have been completed, hence whether the describing them content remains valid, or has rather become obsolete, either due to the elapsed time or based on the provision of additional context. Additionally, we also discuss several novel datasets that we have constructed for probing LLMs and NLP models in general when it comes to temporal validity estimation and reasoning.

                Adam Jatowt is a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Innsbruck, Austria. He also serves as a Deputy Head of the Digital Science Center and Deputy Head of the Research Center Digital Humanities at the University of Innsbruck. Adam received his Ph.D. degree in Information Science & Technology from the University of Tokyo in 2005, and afterwards he worked at Kyoto University for 14 years, first as an Assistant and later as an Associate Professor. His research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, information retrieval and artificial intelligence. Adam is on the editorial board of IP&M, JASIST, IJDL, and JIIS journals, as well as serves as a Senior PC member of SIGIR, WSDM, CIKM, ECIR, SIGIR-AP and JCDL conferences. He is a recipient of the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award by the Humboldt Society and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s (KIT) International Excellence Fellowship.

<li>14h50 Riwal Lefort - Artificial Intelligence in bancassurance
        
        <details style="margin-left:50px"><summary> Details </summary>
                <b>Abstract:</b> <br> In this presentation, we address the subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in bancassurance.
After giving a vision of AI and a few general definitions, we present a large number of use cases specific to the bancassurance sector.
We will see that AI can occupy the entire information system, from the front office (customer relations) to the back office (data center management), via the middle offices (decision support).
We'll also see that all types of data are present: textual data (e-mails, news articles, etc.), images (invoice scans, account statements, etc.), bank transaction labels, etc.
Next, we'll look at the specifics and workflow of an AI project in bancassurance. Indeed, regulations impose strict constraints on the monitoring and explicability of AI models.
We conclude with a discussion on the adoption of generative AI: can it be used? What precautions need to be taken?
                <br><br><b>Bio :</b><br>
After 10 years of academic research in Machine Learning for computer vision, bioinformatics or underwater acoustics, Riwal LEFORT was recruited in 2017 at Crédit Mutuel Arkéa (CMA) to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the group. His work at CMA focuses on setting up and monitoring AI projects, but he also takes part in internal AI training courses and helps formalize AI projects (procedures and protocols).
