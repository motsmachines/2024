## Call for Papers: Terminology

Coming soon...

### Important Dates

**Submission deadline: 22 February 2023**

**Notification: 1 March 2023**

**Workshop: 17 March 2023**

### Context

Terminology is a particularly important subject for technical translation and writing. Understanding technical or scientific documents can be challenging for users, including translators, technical writers or citizens. Searching for terminology and its explanation could help to mitigate this problem. One of the goals of this workshop is to explore the advantages and the limits of the emerging AI technologies to help a user to understand a complex scientific or technical document.

The workshop aims to provide a communication platform for an interdisciplinary community of researchers in terminology, translation, technical writing, AI, natural language processing, information retrieval, linguistics, and didactics. 

The workshop "Words/Machines #5: Terminology" is organized by  the HCTI research laboratory, UBO master program in Translation and Technical writing, and the movement SimpleText at CNRS GDR MADICS.

The workshop is proposed within the framework of AXIS 2: Temporality and materiality - Transfers and contacts - Translation and adaptation of text of the five-year research programme of the HCTI research laboratory. It is directly in line with Brittany's research and innovation strategy (S3), more precisely the Secure and Responsible Digital Economy - Data & Intelligence, and is part of the Digital & Industrial Transitions approach for digital innovation at the service of economic transformation.
