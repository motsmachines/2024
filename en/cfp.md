### Important Dates

**Workshop: 8 March 2024**

### Context

The deployment of state-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, LLama, Dall-E, has raised many questions concerning creativity. Despite considerable progress in the field of large language models (LLMs), the automatic processing of creative language, including humoristic and poetic texts, is an ongoing challenge for artificial intelligence and natural language processing systems. Although some commercial organizations have conducted research into humor detection and generation, deploying the production of generated humor in conversational agents is risky as these agents could reveal undesirable stereotyping biases that propagate negative stereotypes involving gender, race, religion and other social constructs. In addition, humor is often linked to social taboos; according to humor relief theory, the comic effect is achieved by relieving tension. To overcome this problem, it is essential to understand the interlocutor's potential feelings.

Creativity, of which humor is a part, could be useful for conversational agents, popularizing science and detecting fake news. It could also be used as a persuasive tool.

The "Mots/Machines #6 : Science, AI, créativity et creation" workshop is organized by the HCTI research laboratory, the UBO Master of Translation and Technical Writing, and the SimpleText action of the CNRS GDR MADICS.

The workshop aims to provide a forum for exchanges on the scientific and practical aspects of AI and creativity. Mots/Machines is aimed at students and researchers alike, enabling them to present the progress of their research and discuss the issues at stake in this rapidly evolving and influential field.
