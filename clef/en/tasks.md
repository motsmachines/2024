### 2022 DataSet
For this edition we use the Citation Network Dataset: DBLP+Citation, ACM Citation network ([https://www.aminer.org/citation](https://www.aminer.org/citation)). An elastic search index is provided to participants accessible through a GUI API. This Index is adequate to:
* apply basic passage retrieval methods based on vector or language IR models
* generate Latent Dirichlet Allocation models,
* train Graph Neural Networks for citation recommendation as carried out in [https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/) for example,
* apply deep bi directionnal transformers for query expansion.
* and much moreâ€¦

### 2022 Queries
For this edition queries are a selection of recent press titles from *The Guardian* enriched with keywords manually extracted from the content of the article. It has been checked that each keyword allows to extract at least 5 relevant abstracts. The use of these keywords is optional.

*Input format for all tasks:*
* Topics are in the MD format
