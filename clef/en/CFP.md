## Context of the workshop
Scientific literacy, including health related questions, is important in order to allow people to make informed decisions, evaluate information quality, maintain physiological and mental health. For example, the stories individuals find credible can determine their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the application of social distancing, using dangerous fake medical treatments, or hoarding panic buying. Unfortunately, stories in social media may be easier for lay people to understand than scientific papers due to the lack of prior background knowledge or complex language and internal vernacular. Scientific texts such as research publications can also be difficult to understand for non domain-experts or scientists outside the publication domain. Improving text comprehensibility and its adaptation to different audiences remains an unresolved problem. From a societal perspective, SimpleText will be a step forward to make the research really open, accessible and understandable for everyone [[1]](#bibliography), to develop a counter-speech to fake news based on scientific results, to allow people to read faster and consequently, become more aware of scientific results, especially with an explosion of open science during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Simplified texts are also more accessible for non-native speakers [[2]](#bibliography), young readers and people with reading disabilities [[3]](#bibliography). Also, text simplification allows the improvement of text-mining and NLP applications, including machine translation results [[4]](#bibliography). Thus, automatic text simplification could be useful for various domains such as scientific communication, scientific journalism, politics, and education.

## Submission Guidelines
Submissions should be written in English following the CEURART 1-column paper style and be submitted as PDF files via the EasyChair system. Papers (except extended abstracts) will be refereed through double-blind peer review. The papers should be original, i.e. not published in an earlier workshop or conference or journal, except for extended abstracts. Literature reviews, position and demo papers, papers on ongoing work or negative results are welcomed. Extended abstracts of previously published works are also welcome. We accept the following types of submissions:  

1. Extended abstracts of 500-1000 words with bibliographic references. Bibliographic references are excluded from word count. Previously published papers can be accepted as extended abstracts (please, provide a reference to your previous work in this case).
2. Regular papers of 10-12 standard pages length with an appropriate number of references.
3. Short papers of 5-6 standard pages length with additional pages for references.
Submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.
